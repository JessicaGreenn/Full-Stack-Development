Summary
This is a business searching web app based on Ajax, RESTful requests and API calls, http requests and communication between client and server sides. 

Functions
Created an applet to search for nearby businesses, such as food and hotels. Besides, it has multiple functions, like auto-locating user’s address when there’s no location input, sorting results according to each heading, displaying business details (like open status, phone nembers, etc.) as user clicks on their name, redirects user to the business’s original Yelp page, etc. 
Used HTML&CSS to design a form at client side to collect user’s input. Passes arguments to server side and adopted Python to call Yelp APIs for business information and calls ipInfo API at client side to get the IP address of user's device. Sends JSON data to client side and display businesses around on the page. The table headings function as sort buttons and business names lead to corresponding detail cards.
